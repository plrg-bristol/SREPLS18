The South of England Regional Programming Language Seminar (*<a href="https://srepls.github.io" target="_blank">S-REPLS</a>*) is a regular and informal meeting for those based in the South of England with a professional interest — whether it be academic or commercial — in the semantics and implementation of programming languages.

### Keynote Speakers

* <a href="https://www.soundandcomplete.org/" target="_blank">Azalea Raad</a> (Imperial College London)
* <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/" target="_blank">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a> (Brown University)

### Talk Proposal

If you would like to contribute a talk, please e-mail Steven Ramsay on <steven.ramsay@bristol.ac.uk> giving a draft title and an abstract by February 15th.

Talks are typically 20-30 minutes long given in person.  Proposals for talks on any topic related to programming languages are invited.  The meeting will be informal, so talks on any related topic at any stage of development (from work submitted for publication to mature projects) are welcome.

Note: the venue is different from that of SREPLS 13.  Watershed is approximately 20 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station.  If you plan to travel by car, there are many <a href="https://travelwest.info/park-ride/" target="_blank">Park and Ride</a> locations that offer easy access to the city centre.
